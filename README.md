# Medicare-Data-Analysis

The present inquiry focuses on Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who suffered from kidney and urinary tract infections with major complications or comorbidity in the City of Baltimore, Maryland, in 2015. In particular, the goal is to discover whether hospital charges in these instances correlate to neighborhood median income and/or the degree of urbanization (or rurality) of the hospital locations. 

The data analysis was performed using SAS Studio University Edition.
